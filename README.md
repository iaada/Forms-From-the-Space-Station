# Forms From the Space Station
This is my collection of forms and paperwork for use in Space Station 14. Originally inspired by Moomoobeef's forms (https://github.com/Moomoobeef/ss14-forms-txt), many elements have been changed and updated to my personal tastes or formatting, in addition to many new forms being created.

The intention of these forms is to minimize on-the-spot explanations of what you need from someone. You can have everything in writing and shortcut straight to talking about the weather, or the argument about if you really deserve Pre-Exoneration for murdering the clown.

## Engaging In Bureaucracy
* Using a form is as simple as finding a pen and your nearest fax machine, printing out what your heart desires, filling in the â– , and handing it to whoever you want.
* Many of these forms are made to have minimal input fields so that they can be edited quickly and simply.
* Many forms will ask for stamps, and some forms may even ask for other forms! Each form will explain what it needs you to do, but watch out for the fine print.
* If you're a power user, try filling out forms ahead of time and saving them. Printing off a finished, hot and ready Hydroponics Request Form can save you lots of time requesting those spicy bananas you love.
