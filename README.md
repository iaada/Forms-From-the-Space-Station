# Forms From the Space Station
A collection of forms, paperwork, bureaucracy, and jokes for use in Space Station 14.

The intention behind these forms is simple and concise delivery of information, to minimize on-the-spot explanations of what you need from someone. You can have everything in writing and shortcut straight to talking about the weather, or arguing about if you really deserve permission for Pre-Exoneration to murder the clown.

## Engaging In Bureaucracy
* Using a form is as simple as finding a pen and your nearest fax machine, printing out what your heart desires, filling in the â– , and handing it to whoever you want.
* Many of these forms are made to have minimal input fields so that they can be edited quickly and simply.
* Many forms will ask for stamps, and some forms may even ask for other forms! Each form will explain what it needs from you, but watch out for the fine print.
* If you're a power user, try filling out forms ahead of time and saving them. Printing off a finished, hot and ready Hydroponics Request Form can save you lots of time requesting those spicy bananas you love.
