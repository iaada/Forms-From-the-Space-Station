# Forms From the Space Station
A collection of forms, paperwork, bureaucracy, and jokes for use in Space Station 14.

The intention behind these forms is simple and concise delivery of information to minimize on-the-spot explanations of what you need from someone. You can have everything in writing and shortcut to talking about the weather, or arguing about if you really deserve permission for Pre-Exoneration to murder the clown.

## Engaging In Bureaucracy
* Using these forms is as simple as finding a pen and a fax machine, printing, filling in the â– , and handing it to the begrudging service worker.
* Many forms are made to have minimal input fields, and some attempt was made at readability and useability in the papercode (but no promises).
* The first paragraph of a form is a concise statement of purpose. You shouldn't need to explain much as you're handing it over.
* If you're a power user try saving filled out forms before the shift. Faxing out a finished H-01 can save lots of time requesting those spicy bananas you love.
