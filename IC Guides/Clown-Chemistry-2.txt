[bold]Greetings, beloved clown![/bold] You're very smart for purchasing this guide. Good job.

Welcome back to chemistry. If you skipped the first guide, you fucked up. You're going to be completely lost and not get anything done. Buy volume one, bozo.

[color=#ff2fff][head=2]Liquid Laughter[/head]
══════════════[/color]
This one is a treat. The perfect additive to any food or drink. All you need is everything we talked about in the last section.

[color=green][italic]// Tools: vial. beaker.
// Machines: Grinder, Centrifuge
// Reagents: 3 bananas.[/italic][/color]
[mono][bold][color=red]): Laughter[/color][/bold]
 + [color=purple]2[/color] Banana
[color=blue]▶ [bold]Juice[/bold][/color]
[color=blue]▶ [bold]Centrifuge[/bold][/color]     [color=#777777]= 10 Sugar, 10 potassium[/color]
 + [color=purple]1[/color] Banana
[color=blue]▶ [bold]Juice[/bold][/color]
[color=red]▶ == 20u Laughter, 10 potassium[/color][/mono]

Be [bold]extremely[/bold] careful! While potassium might sound like liquid Banana, but it [bold]explodes[/bold] in contact with Water.

 ▪ 3 Bananas and some machines are all you need.
 ▪ Juice 2 Bananas into a delicous Juice using the grinder. Yes, the grinder also juices.
 ▪ Put your Banana Juice into a vial, and then the centrifuge.
 ▪ Turn on the centrifuge.
 ▪ Put the vial in the grinder/juicer and juice another Banana.
 ▪ [bold]Kapow![/bold] Delicous (and dangerous) Liquid Laughter.

[color=#ff2fff][head=2]Smoke[/head]
══════════════[/color]
Nothing says funny like a thick cloud of smoke covering the room. And all you need is some Bananas and plastic.

[color=green][italic]// Tools: vial. beaker. payload.
// Machines: Grinder, Centrifuge
// Reagents: 1 Banana, 1 plastic.[/italic][/color]
[mono][bold][color=red]): Smoke[/color][/bold]
 + [color=purple]1[/color] Banana
[color=blue]▶ [bold]Juice[/bold][/color]
[color=blue]▶ [bold]Centrifuge[/bold][/color]
[color=green]▶ [bold]Separate[/bold][/color]       [color=#f39f27].= 5u Sugar, 5u potassium[/color]
 + [color=purple]1[/color] plastic
[color=blue]▶ [bold]Grind[/bold][/color]
[color=green]▶ [bold]Separate[/bold][/color]       [color=#f39f27].= 5u Phosphorus, 5 Oil[/color]
[color=#c96dbf]▶ [bold]Payload[/bold][/color]        [color=red]== Smoke[/color][/mono]

Don't get too excited. You're gonna need to quintuple this recipe if you want to cover an entire room.

 ▪ Juice a Banana. (Maybe you know where this is going.)
 ▪ Centrifuge your Banana Juice. (Did you guess correctly?)
 ▪ This is [bold]very[/bold] important. You're going to need a whole [bold]second[/bold] container.
 ▪ Put your second container into the juicer, and grind up a sheet of plastic.
 ▪ [bold]Kapow![/bold] Mix your vial into the plastic liquid and smoke billows out! It'll taste a bit like Oil but don't worry about that.

[color=#ff2fff][head=2]Laughing Gas[/head]
══════════════[/color]
I know why you're really here. You want the big ticket chemical. Well don't worry, because Laughing Gas is what it's all been building towards.

[color=green][italic]// Tools: Vial. beaker. payload.
// Machines: Grinder, Centrifuge
// Reagents: 3 Bananas, 1 Sugar packet, 2 plastic.[/italic][/color]
[mono][bold][color=red]): Laughing Gas[/color][/bold]
 + [color=purple]2[/color] Banana
[color=blue]▶ [bold]Juice[/bold][/color]
[color=blue]▶ [bold]Centrifuge[/bold][/color]
 + [color=purple]1[/color] Banana
[color=blue]▶ [bold]Juice[/bold][/color]
 + [color=purple]1[/color] Sugar packet
[color=green]▶ [bold]Separate[/bold][/color]    [color=#f39f27].= 20u Laughter, 10u potassium,
                 10u Sugar[/color]
 + [color=purple]2[/color] plastic
[color=blue]▶ [bold]Grind[/bold][/color]
[color=green]▶ [bold]Separate[/bold][/color]    [color=#f39f27].= 10u Phosphorus, 10 Oil[/color]
[color=#c96dbf]▶ [bold]Payload[/bold][/color]     [color=red]== Laughing Gas[/color][/mono]

Ready? Here we go.

 ▪ Juice and centrifuge 2 Bananas.
 ▪ Juice another Banana.
 ▪ Move your liquid to a larger container.
 ▪ Add a packet of Sugar.
 ▪ In a new (empty!) container, grind up 2 sheets of plastic.
 ▪ [bold]Kapow![/bold] Mix your liquids and you've got the whole room laughing, whether they want to or not. Honk.

You might be disapointed in the amount of smoke. Lucky for you, I already showed how to make more of it! It might require some thinking, but you're very smart. You can do it.

Will there be a volume 3? Hell if I know. Donk Co. are the ones paying for this. Go bother them if you want volume 3.
