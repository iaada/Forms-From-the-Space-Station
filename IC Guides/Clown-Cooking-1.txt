[bold]Greetings, beloved clown![/bold] You're very smart for purchasing this guide. Good job.

A clown has no greater frenemy than the chef (other than Mime, the Captain, the security department, and Ian). Chef loves the clown and their funny antics, but is often too shy to admit it. So if chef isn't playing nice, this is the guide for you.

[color=#ff2fff][head=2]Baked Banana Peel[/head]
══════════════[/color]
A non-clown may ask why you'd want to bake a banana peel. I asked this same question, and I'm told it's funnier somehow. I'm also told that it contains trace amounts of narcotics.

 ▪ Put a banana peel in the microwave.
 ▪ Turn the microwave on.

[color=#ff2fff][head=2]Banana Cream Pie[/head]
══════════════[/color]
Let's not waste time getting to what really matters. Here's how to cook a banana cream pie.

[color=green][italic]// Tools: beaker.
// Machines: Microwave
// Ingredients: Flour. salt. 1 pie tin. 2 eggs. 3 Bananas.[/italic][/color]
[mono][bold][color=red]): Banana Cream Pie[/color][/bold]

 + [color=purple]15[/color] Flour
 + [color=purple]5 [/color] salt
 + [color=purple]12[/color] raw egg   [color=#f39f27].= 1 pie dough[/color]

I assume your eyes glazed over? Let's explain it again.

 ▪ Get a beaker or cup.
 ▪ Add 3 scoops of flour and half a salt packet.
 ▪ Add 2 eggs. Make sure they're real eggs, and not the crappy ones botany grows.
 ▪ A pie dough should grow. If one doesn't grow, just add more flour, salt, and eggs until it does.
 ▪ Add your dough, pie tin, and 3 bananas to the microwave.
 ▪ Cook for 15 seconds.
 ▪ [bold]Wapow![/bold] Hot and ready for the face of your next frenemy.

Burgers are great for expressing yourself. Stack it high with all your favorite foods!

 ▪ Pour water and flour into a cup until a dough ball appears.
 ▪ Watch out! Carefully cut the dough with a knife. If you don't have a knife, ask security for one.
 ▪ Microwave your dough slices at 5 seconds each.
 ▪ Get help cutting the buns, or bravely cut them yourself.
 ▪ Take your bottom bun and add the toppings! There's no wrong answers here, but meat and cheese is a classic.
 ▪ Add your top bun.
 ▪ [bold]Wapow![/bold] Your beautiful work of art is finished.
 ▪ Your burger might transform. This is normal.
