[bold]This [color=#c96dbf]glossary[/color] is to aid in communication with a [color=#c96dbf]brain[/color] following its connection to a [color=#c96dbf]Man-Machine Interface[/color]. Procedure for communicating is detailed on the G-08.[/bold]

[color=#c96dbf][head=2] Brain [/head][/color]

An organ responsible for memory and thought. Alternative names: sentient slime core.

[color=#c96dbf][head=2] M.M.I. [/head][/color]

Abbreviation of Man-Machine Interface.

[color=#c96dbf][head=2] Man-Machine Interface [/head][/color]

The Man-Machine Interface is a proprietary technology developed by Nanotrasen for use in the recycling of brains. Live brains connected to an M.M.I. are able to operate at near 100% mental acuity after the initial trauma.

[color=#c96dbf][head=2]"Trauma from overstimulation" [/head][/color]

Nearly all brains suffer a sudden trauma to their short-term memory following a connection to a Man-Machine Interface. This trauma is the result of an overstimulation to the senses. Studies show that damage to the brain is rarely permanent.

[color=#c96dbf][head=2]"Memory of the past 24 hours"[/head][/color]

The connection of a brain to a Man-Machine Interface in nearly all cases results in loss of memory. Long-term memory is uncommonly affected. However, studies show that memory of the last 24 hours is rarely remembered accurately. These altered memories are called "dreams."

[color=#c96dbf][head=2] Dreams [/head][/color]

A "dream" is when an event feels unmistakably real, but in truth is a constructed memory as a result of damage to the hippocampus, cortex, or similar region of the brain.

[color=#c96dbf][head=2] Disposal [/head][/color]

Disposal of a brain is to be done in the manner requested, or by delivery to medical if disposal is not requested.

[color=#c96dbf][head=2]"Matter of operations" [/head][/color]

The operations and activities of the Department of Science are not to be discussed.
