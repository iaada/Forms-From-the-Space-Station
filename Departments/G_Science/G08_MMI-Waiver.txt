Try to calm yourself as I ask you a few routine questions.

Three. Do you understand what has happened to you?

[color=blue] ■ [/color]

Four. Do you understand that as a result of your trauma, any memories of the past 24 hours are likey to be "dreams", and are not real?

Final Question. Do you wish to remain connected to this Man-Machine Interface, thereby waiving your crewmanship?
