Greetings. You have just experienced a trauma from overwhelming senses. Take a moment to calm yourself, as I ask you a few routine questions.

One. Do you know who you are?

Two. Do you know where you are?

Three. Do you understand what has happened to you?
[color=blue]   ■   [/color]

Four. Do you understand that as a result of your trauma, any memory of the past 24 hours are likey to be hallucinations, and not real?

Final Question. Do you wish to remain connected to this Man-Machine Interface, thereby legally waiving your crewmanship?
